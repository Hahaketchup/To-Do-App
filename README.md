# To-Do-App

<br>

_Here is a To Do List written using vanilla HTML/CSS as well as basic Javascript_

<br>

This app allows users to create a list of items to do and remove once completed. It will also store the data being entered in between uses even after exiting the program using Local Storage.

## Summary

This app really challenged me to understand new concepts and functions of javascript such as local storage and allowing user input. I enjoyed the complexity of a seemingly simple app as well as getting into the mindset of a programmer, rather than someone who just typed at a computer wanting to spit some code out.
