# To-Do-App

_Here is a To Do List written using vanilla HTML/CSS as well as basic Javascript_

This app allows users to create a list of items to do and remove once completed. It will also store the data being entered in between uses even after exiting the program using Local Storage.

## Summary

I had finally taken my first step to being a programmer early 2019 by buying class after class. It wasn't until later that year that I had actually put the effort in to begin putting into practice what I had learned and gotten serious about doing so.

This is my first major step to being the programmer that I want to be, and while it's simple, it's a major step for me. It's been a great learning experience.
